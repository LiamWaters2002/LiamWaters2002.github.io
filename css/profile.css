.profile-container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
}

.profile-picture img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  max-width: 500px; /* Adjust this value as needed */
}

.profile-text {
  margin-left: 20px;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 900px) {
  .profile-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  .profile-picture img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}
In the updated CSS:

The width property of the .profile-picture img selector is set to 100%. This ensures that the image occupies the full width of its container, regardless of the screen size.
The max-width property of the .profile-picture img selector is still present, allowing the image to scale down on larger screens while retaining a maximum width of 500 pixels. You can adjust this value to your desired maximum width.
The height property of the .profile-picture img selector is set to auto, allowing the image to maintain its aspect ratio and adjust its height proportionally based on the width.
With these modifications, the profile picture should resize correctly when emulating a mobile device.
